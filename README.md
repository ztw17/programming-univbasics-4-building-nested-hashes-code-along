# Building Nested Hashes Code Along

## Learning Goals

- Build a nested `Hash`.
- Access and manipulate data in nested `Hash`es.

## Preface

At Flatiron School our data show that many students who do not spend time with
this code-along have their progress slowed down by over 10x versus those who
actually code this challenge. Please actually CODE ALONG. Reading READMEs and
code is not like reading a gossip web site where you can shrug, say "Seems
good," and _have_ the knowledge. You must work through the materials.

## Code Along Challenge: Epic Tragedy

You're 16 years old and back in high school English class. Luckily for us, our
teacher is kind of lazy and we get to watch the *Romeo and Juliet* movie from
the '90s starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes.

But there's a Romeo and Juliet quiz our teacher has scheduled for us that we
need to get ready for. We will definitely be required to answer some questions
about the cast of characters and their attributes and relationships to one another.
Let's map out that information:

![](http://learn-co-curriculum.s3.amazonaws.com/nested-hashes-romeo-juliet.png)

What we have here is a nested data structure. There are different levels or
tiers of information. On the top tier, we have the family names. Beneath that we
have key characters, and beneath that we have their attributes. We have an
additional layer of the hero/heroine's friends because there are multiple
friends. Now that we have a sense of the structure that our collection of
information is taking, we're going to build a nested `Hash` that displays it in
the same nested way. Our end result will look like this:

```ruby
epic_tragedy = {
  :montague => {
    :patriarch => {  
      :name => "Lord Montague",
      :age => "53"
  },
    :matriarch => {
      :name => "Lady Montague",
      :age => "54"
  },
    :hero => {
      :name => "Romeo",
      :age => "15"
  },
    :hero_friends => [
      {
         :name => "Benvolio",
         :age => "17",
         :attitude => "worried"
      },
      {
        :name => "Mercutio",
        :age => "18",
        :attitude => "hot-headed"
      }
    ]
  },
  :capulet => {
    :patriarch => {
      :name => "Lord Capulet",
      :age => "50"
    },
    :matriarch => {
      :name => "Lady Capulet",
      :age => "51"
    },
    :heroine => {
      :name => "Juliet",
      :age => "15",
      :status => "alive"
    },
    :heroine_friends=> [
      {
        :name => "Steven",
        :age => "30",
        :attitude => "confused"
      },
      {
        :name => "Nurse",
        :age => "44",
        :attitude => "worried"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

> **Note:** You might notice that we are storing ages as `String`s. That is
because the ages here are not numbers that we need to frequently do math with.
If a `Hash` value was a number that we needed to manipulate, then we would
store it as an `Integer`. For example, if it was the price of an item that we
need to calculate the tax on, then the price would be stored as an `Integer` or
float.  Otherwise,  it is conventional to store information like a person's age
as a `String`.

Remember that the `key: value` syntax is the same as the `:key => value` syntax
used above. Get ready to see them both used in different applications and
sources.

## Instructions

This is a complicated data structure, so we're going to build it up one step at
a time. Follow along with the walk-through below.

### Code Along Challenge I: Family Names

In `lib/first_challenge.rb`, you're going to fill out the content of the
`epic_tragedy` `Hash`. The first level of our nested `Hash` are the keys for the
family names, "Montague" and "Capulet". We've made them `Symbol`s above, because
symbols make better `Hash` keys than `String`s.

* Set the `epic_tragedy` variable equal to a `Hash` with two key/value pairs. The
keys should be symbols of the family names (`:montague` and `:capulet`) and the
values should be empty `Hash`es.

At this point, we have a `Hash` that looks like this:

```ruby
epic_tragedy = {
  :montague => {},
  :capulet => {}
}
```

Now it's time to fill out the second level of our `Hash` â€” the collection of data
that constitutes the value `Hash`es of each family name key.

### Code Along Challenge II: Character Roles

In `lib/second_challenge.rb`, you'll find the `Hash` you built in the previous
challenge.

Fill out the empty `Hash` that is the value of the `:montague` key. There are four
keys in this `Hash`:

* `:patriarch`
* `:matriarch`
* `:hero`
* `:hero_friends`

The first three of these keys point to a value of an empty `Hash`. The fourth key
`:hero_friends` has a value of an empty `Array`.

Then, do the same for the empty `Hash` that is the value of the `:capulet` key.
This time, your keys are:

* `:patriarch`
* `:matriarch`
* `:heroine`
* `:heroine_friends`

The values are the same as described above. Once you get this test passing, you
should have a `Hash` that looks like this:

```ruby
epic_tragedy = {
   :montague => {
      :patriarch => {},
      :matriarch => {},
      :hero => {},
      :hero_friends => []
   },
   :capulet => {
      :patriarch => {},
      :matriarch => {},
      :heroine => {},
      :heroine_friends => []
   }
}
```

Now we're ready to fill out the empty `Hash`es that constitute the values for the
`:patriarch`, `:matriarch` and `:hero`/`:heroine` keys, nested inside the family
name keys of our epic `epic_tragedy hash`.


### Code Along Challenge III: Character Attributes

According to the diagram that we saw at the very beginning of this exercise,
each character has a set of attributes. Matriarch and Patriarchs have a name and
an age. The hero and heroine each have a name, age and a status.

In `lib/third_challenge`, you'll find the `Hash` that you built in the previous
challenge. Fill out the empty `Hash`es that are the values of the `:patriarch`,
`:matriarch`, and `:hero`/`:heroine` keys with the following key/value pairs.

* The Montague `:patriarch` has
  * a `:name` of "Lord Montague" and
  * an `:age` of "53".
* The Montague `:matriarch` has
  * a `:name` of "Lady Montague" and
  * an `:age` of "54".
* The Montague `:hero` has
  * a `:name` of "Romeo",
  * an `:age` of "15", and
  * a `:status` of "alive".
* The Capulet `:patriarch` has
  * a `:name` of "Lord Capulet" and
  * an `:age` of "50".
* The Capulet `:matriarch` has
  * a `:name` of "Lady Capulet" and
  * an `:age` of "51".
* The Capulet `:heroine` has
  * a `:name` of "Juliet",
  * an `:age` of "15", and
  * a `:status` of "alive".

Once you get this test passing, you should have the following `Hash`:

```ruby
epic_tragedy = {
   :montague => {
      :patriarch => {name: "Lord Montague", age: "53"},
      :matriarch => {name: "Lady Montague", age: "54"},
      :hero => {name: "Romeo", age: "15", status: "alive"},
      :hero_friends => []
   },
   :capulet => {
      :patriarch => {name: "Lord Capulet", age: "50"},
      :matriarch => {name: "Lady Capulet", age: "51"},
      :heroine => {name: "Juliet", age: "15", status: "alive"},
      :heroine_friends => []
   }
}
```

We're almost done. Our hero and heroine have two friends each. That constitutes
a collection of friends. Since they each have a collection of friends, it makes
sense to collect those friends in an `Array`. Since each friend will have his or
her own attributes (name, age, etc), our `Array` will be *an `Array` of `Hash`es*!

### Code Along Challenge IV: Nesting Friends and Attributes

The values of the `:hero_friends` and `:heroine_friends` keys currently point to
empty `Array`s. Why `Array`s? Well, we know that an individual person can be
represented by a `Hash`. However, our hero and heroine have multiple friends. So,
we need a way to store their friends in list-form. Luckily for us, that's just
what `Array`s are for.

Fill out these empty `Array`s with a series of `Hash`es that will contain key/value
pairs describing these friends.

The hero's two friends are Benvolio and Mercutio. So, the `:hero_friends` `Array`
will contain two `Hash`es. Each of these two `Hash`es have the following three keys:

* `:name`
* `:age`
* `:attitude`

The hero's first friend has

* a name of "Benvolio",
* an age of "17", and
* an attitude of "worried".

The hero's second friend has

* a name of "Mercutio",
* an age of "18", and
* an attitude of "hot-headed".

The heroine's two friends are Steven and Nurse. So, the `:heroine_friends` `Array`
will contain two `Hash`es. Each of these two `Hash`es have the following three keys:

* `:name`
* `:age`
* `:attitude`

The heroine's first friend has

* a name of "Steven",
* an age of "30", and
* an attitude of "confused".

The heroine's second friend has

* a name of "Nurse",
* an age of "44", and
* an attitude of "worried".

Once you get this test passing, your `Hash` should look like this:

```ruby
epic_tragedy = {
   :montague => {
      :patriarch => {name: "Lord Montague", age: "53"},
      :matriarch => {name: "Lady Montague", age: "54"},
      :hero => {name: "Romeo", age: "15", status: "alive"},
      :hero_friends => [
         {name: "Benvolio", age: "17", attitude: "worried"},
         {name: "Mercutio", age: "18", attitude: "hot-headed"}
      ]
   },
   :capulet => {
      :patriarch => {name: "Lord Capulet", age: "50"},
      :matriarch => {name: "Lady Capulet", age: "51"},
      :heroine => {name: "Juliet", age: "15", status: "alive"},
      :heroine_friends => [
          {name: "Steven", age: "30", attitude: "confused"},
          {name: "Nurse", age: "44", attitude: "worried"}
      ]
   }
}

```

## Bonus: Manipulating the Hash

In the previous lesson we learned that you can access a value in a `Hash` like
this:

```ruby
hash = {first: "first value!", second: "second value!"}

hash[:first]
#  => "first value!"
```

To access the values in our nested `Hash`, we simply tack on additional keys,
until we have the last key that points to the value we want to access.

For example, to access the Montague patriarch's name, I use the `Hash` name,
`epic_tragedy`, followed by a chained list of all of the key names that precede
the value of his name, enclosed in brackets:

```ruby
epic_tragedy[:montague][:patriarch][:name]
#  => "Lord Montague"
```

We can even use this method to change the value of a particular key. If we
wanted to reset the Montague patriarch's name to "Michael Jordan", we would do
it in the following way:

```ruby
epic_tragedy[:montague][:patriarch][:name] = "Michael Jordan"

puts epic_tragedy

#  =>
{
   :montague => {
      :patriarch => {name: "Michael Jordan", age: "53"},
      :matriarch => {name: "Lady Montague", age: "54"},
      :hero => {name: "Romeo", age: "15", status: "alive"},
      :hero_friends => [
        {name: "Benvolio", age: "17", attitude: "worried"},
        {name: "Mercutio", age: "18", attitude: "hot-headed"}
      ]
   },
   :capulet => {
      :patriarch => {name: "Lord Capulet", age: "50"},
      :matriarch => {name: "Lady Capulet", age: "51"},
      :heroine => {name: "Juliet", age: "15", status: "alive"},
      :heroine_friends => [
        {name: "Steven", age: "30", attitude: "confused"},
        {name: "Nurse", age: "44", attitude: "worried"}
      ]
   }
}
```

### Bonus Code Along Challenge

In `lib/bonus.rb` you'll see our completed `epic_tragedy hash`. We're coming to
the end of the epic tragedy of Romeo and Juliet. At this point in the story,
Romeo and Juliet are â€” as in every good tragedy â€” quite dead. Use the above
method to change the status of our hero Romeo and our heroine Juliet from
"alive" to "dead". These are bonus and if you're feeling comfortable with
Hashes, feel free to move forward. Also, to enable these tests make sure to
remove the `x` in front of the `it` block in spec/bonus_spec.rb.

## Conclusion

Nested `Hash`es can be very complex! However, their structure is very consistent.
Once data is contained within a `Hash`, as long as we have the right keys, we can
access data from anywhere on the `Hash`, no matter how deeply nested the data is.

Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow, That I shall say good
night till it be morrow.
